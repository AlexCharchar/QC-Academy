        <!-- === Testimonial 3: Tiffany (17 yrs in hairdressing) === -->
    <div class="testimonial">
      <img src="QC_Media_Formated_Academy/tiffany_certificate.jpg" alt="Graduate holding diploma">
      <p class="testimonial-text">"Seventeen years of experience in the hairdressing industry and one would think that with that much experience, adding the focus of barbering would be somewhat a simple task. Though having the background knowledge was a much-added bonus, with all that I knew, there was still much more to learn. The amount of “aha” moments I experienced, as well as unlearning bad habits were immense."</p>
      <p class="testimonial-text">"I wanted to take this course to add more tools to my toolbox and give my clients a more professional and precise service. I came to the right place. William Biney is PASSIONATE about his profession. He is patient and encouraging. He has created a safe space for people of all ages and walks of life to learn and feel confident about what they are doing. I left with the tools I went to collect and more. Thank you for the experience."</p>

    <!-- === Testimonial 1: John Rennie HS, Grade 10 === -->
    <div class="testimonial">
      <img src="QC_Media_Formated_Academy/kev_shear_cutting.jpg" alt="Student cutting hair">
      <p class="testimonial-text">"I’ve been learning how to cut hair through Youtube and trying to learn on my own, but I wasn’t getting pretty far. When I saw my school was offering the chance to learn how to cut hair through the QC Academy, I knew I had to take the opportunity. I really enjoyed the program; getting to meet many experienced barbers and mainly getting actual learning experiences on how to cut hair. My favorite part of the program had to be seeing how every barber is unique, and all use different techniques on cutting hair."</p>

    <!-- === Testimonial 2: John Rennie HS, Grade 9 === -->
    <div class="testimonial">
      <img src="QC_Media_Formated_Academy/1_framed.jpg" alt="Student holding framed certificate">
      <p class="testimonial-text">"I signed up to the program because when I saw the opportunity at school to take it I figured it would be a great way to pick up an important skill and I’ve always really liked haircutting. Just the idea that you can build someone’s confidence in the span of 30 minutes is a concept that truly resonates with me. I found I really enjoyed the program. The shop itself was a comfortable and happy environment; all of the barbers are very kind and patient. I knew I had something to look forward to every week. My favourite part of the program was during the theory portion, week 5, when we all practiced cutting hair on manikins. I remember being too nervous to use the clippers at first, but all the barbers reassured me. It was so much fun."</p>
      <p class="testimonial-text">I would highly recommend the program. Even if you feel that you’re not interested in barbering, I really do believe it’s an eye opener. The program shows you a different perspective to barbering. Every class is so productive; all of the barbers clearly know what they’re doing because I didn’t know how to hold scissors before the program and now I cut all my friends’ hair.</p>

    <!-- === Testimonial 4: Mother of student === -->
    <div class="testimonial">
      <img src="QC_Media_Formated_Academy/2_framed.jpg" alt="Student receiving guidance">
      <p class="testimonial-text">"Enrolling my son in the high-school barbering program has been one of the best decisions we’ve ever made. Over the past few months, I’ve witnessed incredible growth in his skills, confidence, and professionalism. The supportive and dedicated team of Will, Zack and Alex has played a crucial role in his development, providing guidance and encouragement every step of the way. This program has not only equipped him with valuable technical abilities but also instilled a strong work ethic and passion for his craft. We are incredibly grateful for the positive impact this experience has had on his personal and professional journey."</p>

    <!-- === Testimonial 5: Father of student === -->
    <div class="testimonial">
      <img src="QC_Media_Formated_Academy/4_framed.jpg" alt="Barber teaching young student">
      <p class="testimonial-text">"My 13-year-old son has wanted to learn how to be a barber for a few years now, and when the chance came through his high school as an extracurricular activity, he jumped at it. He learned SO MUCH in the class, got great training, and practiced on volunteer clients for several weeks (under the guidance and supervision of the teachers), giving him invaluable experience. Also, the atmosphere at Quality Cuts is fantastic! The teachers/barbers are great guys, and they were so patient, helpful, knowledgeable, and have great experience with kids and adults alike. I 100 % highly recommend this barbershop, and this unique and fantastic program that they have going on there!"</p>

      <p class="testimonial-text">"I want to take a moment to express my gratitude for all that you did for our students in the 10-Week Barber Program. Your dedication, guidance, and unwavering support have made a profound impact on each one of us, especially the students."</p>
      <p class="testimonial-text">"Thank you for your endless patience as you teach the intricacies of barbershop etiquette, harmony, and performance. Your expertise and passion for the art form shone through in every lesson."</p>
      <p class="testimonial-text">"Moreover, your mentorship goes beyond just cutting. You provided invaluable lessons such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Your belief in the students motivates them to push forward for a potential career in the future. Please know that your efforts are deeply appreciated and not taken for granted. You’re not just teachers; you’re mentors shaping the lives of these students in a profound way. Thank you once again for everything you do.

    <div class="testimonial">
      <img src="QC_Media_Formated_Academy/damian_head_shot.jpg" alt="Teacher giving feedback">
      <p class="testimonial-text">"The students really enjoyed the activity. They felt that the whole experience was really fun and informative while still being taken seriously. They felt that the staff was supportive, that all explanations were clear and that no questions were left unanswered. They appreciated that they were introduced to different aspects of entrepreneurship. They now feel confident enough to start their own little business!"</p>
      <p class="testimonial-text">"As a teacher supervising the students during the activity, I will certainly push for this activity to be offered again to the students next year."</p>
